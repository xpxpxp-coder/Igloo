//! Conformance "row zero": `req.community = resolve_host(connection.host)`,
//! bound at connection establishment. The host is the authoritative selector;
//! an unknown or unmapped host fails closed with a generic rejection and never
//! falls through to a default tenant. A client-supplied community (e.g. a token
//! stamp or an `h` tag) may narrow or authenticate authority but can never
//! override the host-derived community.
//!
//! This module owns the *seam* (the [`HostResolver`] trait and the fail-closed
//! [`bind_community`] helper) and the relay-side call site. The DB-backed
//! implementation that queries the `communities` table lives in `buzz-db`
//! (`Db::resolve_host`); the relay depends on the trait, not the query, so the
//! binding is testable without a database.
